kcs requires four packages to be installed: scitools-iris, Pandas,
h5py and toml.  Installing scitools-iris will also bring in NumPy,
SciPy, Matplotlib, Dask, Cartopy, NetCDF4 and a few minor packages, as
its dependencies.

Since several of Iris's dependencies depend on various C libraries, it
may be better, and easier, to use Conda to install scitools-iris
(Conda can also install h5py and toml, but you can also use pip in the
Conda environment to install these): this will guarantee that the
correct version of the C libraries and their dependencies are
installed.

You can read the Iris installation guide at
https://scitools.org.uk/iris/docs/latest/installing.html .

Or simply download Miniconda from
https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html (pick the Python 3
version) and install that. With Miniconda installed, and the `conda`
command available, you can run:

    conda install --name kcs --channel conda-forge iris h5py toml
	conda activate kcs

(or pick your favourite environment name.)

kcs itself is not available through Conda. Instead, just install it
using `pip` in the Conda environment:

    pip install kcs

But if you want the most recent version (possibly with bug-fixes),
install it directly from its source repository:

    pip install git+https://github.com/evertrol/kcs.git

You may need to add `--upgrade`, `--force-reinstall` and `--no-deps`
to force an upgrade, especially if the change in the repository was
minor and the package version was not upgraded.
